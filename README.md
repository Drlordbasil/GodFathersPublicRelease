# GodFathers Public Release

GodFathers Public Release symbolizes the inception of an autonomous era in software development. Bridging the genius of gpt4all and OpenAI, this repository is dedicated to Python programming, autonomously generating innovative ideas, engineering prompts into programs, and uploading them to GitHub.

## Vision
To evolve into a fully autonomous, free-to-run software entity that ideates and autonomously crafts repositories housing project files, thus redefining software development paradigms.
